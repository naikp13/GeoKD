# GEOKD: Geospatial  Knowledge Distillation

GEOKD is an open-source Python framework designed to simplify **knowledge distillation (KD)** and **compressive fin-tuning** of Geospatial foundation models, such Prithvi, TerraMind etc., and other multi-modal architectures. With a focus on flexibility, reproducibility, and efficiency, GEOKD aims to distill large geosptial foundation models into smaller, faster, and resource-efficient versions while maintaining high performance.

The repository is under development and will be published soon....
